lan switch makes his decision based on his table
(how the table is  )

-there's two methods of fowarding frames
store and foward (the switch read the entire frame and computes the CRC )
cut through( the switch read only at minimum the destination address)
fragement free (modified form of cut through siwthc )

-memory buffering is used to store frames before sending them . buffering may also be used when 
the port is busy there's two types of buffering
port-based memory which is a port memory where frames are stored on queues
shaed memory which is switch memory that is shared by all ports

-there are two types of duplex settings 
Full-duplex in which both ends sends and recevies simultaneosly
Half-duplex where each end have to send at a time

-connection between switch to switch , switch to router, switch to host and router to host once 
required specific cable type .but it's not the case now if you run mdix auto command


-if switch is working in half-duplex then he will join the collision domain which is not the case if he's in full fpluex
-when switches are interconnected they form a signle broadcast domain

-there's a virtual switch interface that can be used to configure mask,address,defaut gateway
By default SV management is controlled by (vlan?)?

-you can enter the interface configuration by interface vlan 99
then you can assign the address network to interface with mask
and you can configure the default gateway which is the router address and it's used by the switch to communicate with 
other networks(apprenettly it's the interface address of the router not the router itself (check))

-check the duplex type by show interface you assign the duplex type by typing it' name 

security : 
there's three type of secure mac address, first the static mac secure address  and it's manually configured and it's saved in the running configuration(stockage permanant)
the second type is the dynamic mac secure address this type is dynamicly learned from the traffic and it's not stored in 
the running configuration.The last type is the sticky secure mac addresse and it has both mannualy and dynamicly learning
process and he store his addresses in the running conifiguration 

-there will be a port security violation if one address is configured in interface and seen on another and if address is seen in a port she's not allowed to access

to configure dynamic port security
interface ..
switchport mode access => allowing access
switchport port-security => enabling security

-to configure sitkcy port security
interface ..
switchport mode access
switchport port-security
switchport port-security maximum 50
switchport port-securtiy mac address sticky => enabling sticky learning

-to see configurtion
show interface port-security ..
show port-security addresses
